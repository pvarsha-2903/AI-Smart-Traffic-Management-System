# Project Roadmap – AI Smart Traffic Management System (PRAVAH)

This roadmap represents the planned development journey of the AI Smart Traffic Management System. The project is being built step-by-step, starting from a basic simulation and gradually evolving into a more intelligent and scalable traffic optimization system.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation 

This initial phase focused on setting up the project and building a basic working simulation.

Completed tasks:
- Created the GitHub repository
- Added detailed project documentation
- Uploaded the original Smart India Hackathon presentation
- Built a basic traffic signal simulation using Python

This phase established the base structure for further development.

---

## Phase 2: Smart Signal Logic (In Progress)

The goal of this phase is to make the signal decision system more realistic and intelligent.

Planned improvements:
- Enhance the traffic decision algorithm
- Implement dynamic signal timing based on traffic density
- Introduce fairness logic to ensure no lane waits excessively long

This will make the simulation closer to real-world traffic behavior.

## Phase 3: AI Vehicle Detection (Upcoming)

In this phase, the system will begin using computer vision techniques.

Planned features:
- Detect vehicles from images or video using AI
- Automatically count vehicles in each lane
- Connect vehicle detection with signal decision logic

This will reduce reliance on manually simulated data.

---

## Phase 4: Dashboard Interface (Future)

This phase will focus on building a visual monitoring system.

Planned features:
- Develop a dashboard to monitor traffic conditions
- Display traffic density and signal status
- Show system decisions in real time

This will improve usability and visualization.

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future)

This phase will introduce more advanced and practical capabilities.

Possible features:
- Emergency vehicle prioritization
- Integration with real-time camera feeds
- Coordination between multiple traffic junctions

These improvements will move the system closer to real-world deployment.

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a scalable, AI-powered traffic management system that can help reduce congestion, waiting time, and fuel wastage in smart cities across India.

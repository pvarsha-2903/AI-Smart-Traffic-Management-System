AI Smart Traffic Management System (PRAVAH)

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered Smart Traffic Management System designed to reduce traffic congestion using adaptive signal timing.

Originally developed for Smart India Hackathon, this version is expanded for India-wide deployment.

## Problem
Traffic congestion causes:

- Time loss
- Fuel waste
- Pollution
- Emergency delays

Current traffic signals use fixed timing, which is inefficient.

## Solution
This system uses:

- AI
- Traffic simulation
- Vehicle detection
- Adaptive signal control

to dynamically adjust traffic lights based on traffic density.

## Features
- Traffic simulation
- AI-based vehicle detection (future)
- Adaptive signal timing
- Emergency vehicle priority (future)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- GitHub
- OpenCV (future)
- Flask (future)
